## ðŸ“Œ Note
This repo is focused on **practice** of React concepts.  
Only the relevant files for each topic are uploaded (e.g., `App.jsx`, `Student.jsx`, `data.js`, and images).  
Unnecessary files like `node_modules`, `package.json`, and full React setup are not included to keep the repo clean and minimal.
