# ✅ To-Do List App (React)

A simple **To-Do List App** built with **React**.  
This app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.  
It's part of my React JS learning journey and focuses on **state management** and **component-based architecture**.

## ✨ Features
- ➕ **Add new tasks** using an input form
- ❌ **Delete tasks** with a single click
- ☑ **Mark tasks as complete** using a checkbox (strikes through text)
- 📱 Responsive & clean UI with basic CSS

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **React** (Functional Components & Hooks)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS3** for styling
